                <div className='about__text'>Our website provides students with the opportunity to order food in the canteen in advance and save time.
                Ordering food through the website can help students reduce waiting time in queues and avoid running out of time during lunch breaks.
                Typically, canteens are often crowded with students during lunchtime, and to avoid long queues, our website offers the possibility to order in advance and then simply pick up the food when it's ready.
                Thus, our website allows students to save time and avoid unnecessary stressful situations related to long waiting times in the canteen queue. 
                It also streamlines the food ordering and preparation process for canteen staff, enabling them to optimize their workflow.</div>

<div className='about__title'>Future Works</div>
<div className='about__text'>There are many potential improvements and additions that can be made to this project in the future.<br/> Some of these may include:<br/>

1. Adding the ability to pay online: this would allow students to place and pay for orders without having to visit the cash register.<br/>

2. Adding the ability to order food for multiple days in advance: this would allow students to plan their lunch breaks ahead of time by ordering food for several days in advance.<br/>

3. Adding a personal account feature for students: this would allow them to view their orders and payment history, as well as save their favorite dishes.<br/>

4. Creating a mobile application: this would make ordering even more convenient for students, as they could place orders directly from their mobile devices.<br/>

5. Implementing a loyalty program: this would incentivize students to place orders more frequently and receive bonuses or discounts on their purchases.<br/>

6. Adding the ability to order delivery: this would allow students to receive their orders directly in the classroom or at another convenient location.<br/>

These are just some ideas that could be implemented to improve this project. Overall, depending on the needs of the students and the desires of the developers, there are many opportunities for improving the project.
